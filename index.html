        <h2>Resume</h2>
        <p>Graphic Design student at Wake Technical Community College ready to work in the outdoor gear industry</p>

        <p>Damian “Bo” Craig is an adventurous 31 year old ready to jump back in to the outdoor gear industry, this time as a graphic designer. Bo spent six months in Australia, first working at a winery, then traveling the Australian Coast Highway from Melbourne to Adelaide. But it was his time spent in Maine, working at LL Bean, that made him want to start his career in graphic design. Bo is observant, intuitive, asks great questions, and has a keen attention to detail. </p>
